browser vs web-server

browser:
front-end
everything visible to the user
HTML, CSS, JS > frontend stack

web-server:
back-end
server is a computer that is connected to the internet; stores a websites files; runs HTTP server that is capable of understanding URLs, requests and also able to deliver responses; this HTTP software is the part that actually communicates with the browser requests

static server vs dynamic server

dynamic server also has an App running on it

database is used to store stuff to fill up a website template; backend will communicate with the DATABASE

web-server is also there to manipulate data in the database

nodeJS is the web-server > backend stack
mongoDB is the database > backend stack
